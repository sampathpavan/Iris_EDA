# Description of dataset

   The dataset contains five columns
   
   The column names are as follows :
   
   1.)SepalLengthCm
   
   2.)SepalWidthCm
   
   3.)PetalLengthCm
   
   4.)PetalWidthCm
   
   5.)Species
   
  Out of these five columns four columns are of float datatype and Species is of type object(Categorical)
  We also see there are 3 different types of species.
  
# Observations

We can see that there are no null values in the dataset

we clearly see that Iris-setosa species is linearly separable from other two species(Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica). The other two species which are Iris-versicolor and Iris-

virginica are not linearly separable to each other.

We can visualize the data by using different plots

Some of the plots i used to visualize are :

1.)Pair plot

2.)Pie plot

3.)Line plot

4.)Scatter plot
